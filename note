Test Case Design Techniques

we don't use test case design techniques for all function in the user story
we use that for if there is some function require some data like number or letter that time we need to use test case design techniques

in test case design techniques we have 2 steps

1) Equivalence class partitioning (ECP)
   here we check positive and negative (valid and invalid) data.
   so here we give between numbers or alphabet like between 1 and 100 or let say alphabet should be max 10 letters so it should be alphabet<10
   and if we give less than 1 or bigger than 100 this are invalid data  or spacial character

2) Boundary value analysis(BVA)
   here we give exact data like
   valid data min number we give 1 max number we give 99
   or data we give 50 this exact number are valid data and we call (BVA)  or alphabet like 5 letter asdgg

   and invalid one is we give 150 or we write 15 letter asdfdfadsfdasdv so this are exact data
